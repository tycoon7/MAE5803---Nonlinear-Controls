%% Consider the following second-order system
%
% $$ \dot{x}_1 = x_2 $$
%
% $$ \dot{x}_2 = -x_1 - (\mu - x^2_1)x_2 $$

%% a) Find the eigenvalues of the linearized system about the equilibrium point, (0,0). Express your answer in terms of $\mu$. Sketch in the complex plane the variation of the locations of these eigenvalues as $\mu$ varies from -0.5 to 0.5.


%% b) Draw the phase portraits of the system using MATLAB for $\mu = -0.2$, $\mu = 0$, and $\mu = 0.2$. Use -2 to 2 range of values for the horizontal and vertical axes.


%% d) What phenomenon do you observe as the parameter, $\mu$, varies from negative to positive? Justify your answer using Poincare-Bendixson Theorem.
